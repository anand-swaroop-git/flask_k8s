# Flask Calculator (Multi Container on Kubernetes)

> **Prerequisite:** Docker, Minikube and Kubernetes should be installed. Then run, minikube start --driver=hyperkit

- To run, just clone the repo, browse inside flask_k8s and run `kubectl apply -f ./k8s`.
- Find your minikube ip by typing the command `minikube ip` and then access that IP in the browser. 
- You will not need to build the images since the images are being pulled from Dockerhub.
